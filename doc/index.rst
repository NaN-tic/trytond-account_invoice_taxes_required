Account Invoice Taxes Required Module
#####################################

The Account Invoice Taxes Required module ensures that all invoice lines have
at least one tax assigned. This is useful to avoid user mistakes when 
introducing invoices with Taxes of 0%, which they will want to query later
but it will not be possible unless at least a tax is used.
